Owners of cafes, fitness centers and other social facilities are expected to prefer boroughs with a high population density. Investors will prefer areas with low housing costs and low competitiveness. On the part of residents, the preference is expected for a boroughs with a low cost of housing and good accessibility of social places. In my research, I will try to determine the optimal places for the location of fitness centers in Moscow boroughs, taking into account the number of people, the cost of real estate and the density of other fitness facilities. The key criteria for selecting suitable locations for fitness centers will be: 
High population of the borough
Low cost of real estate in the borough
The absence in the immediate vicinity of other fitness facilities
I will use the approaches and methods of machine learning to determine the location of fitness centers in accordance with the specified criteria.

The main stakeholders of my research will be investors interested in opening new fitness centers.
